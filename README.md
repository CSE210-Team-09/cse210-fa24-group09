# CSE210 Team 9 Code Snippet Saver

## Project Description

Our project is a CRUD web-based Code Snippet Saver. It allows the users to add, store, view, and edit code snippets with comments. 

The goal of this project was to develop a better alternative for students and researchers who used platforms like Google Docs, Obsidian, or similar tools to save code snippets but found them unsatisfactory.

Within 4 weeks, we were able to design and implement this application in a small group. This project allowed us to learn web programming while working in a group with regular sprints.

Our application's deployment to Github Pages and a video demonstrating its functionality are both linked below. The next section also includes a link to our documentation generated using JSDocs.
