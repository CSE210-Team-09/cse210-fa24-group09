# CSE210 Team 9 Code Snippet Saver

## Project Description
Our project is a CRUD web-based Code Snippet Saver. It allows the users to add, store, view, and edit code with comments. The goal of this project was to build a better alternative for students and researchers who were using Google Docs, Obsidian, or other solutions to save code snippets and were unhappy with it. Within 4 weeks, we were able to design and implement this application in a small group. This project allowed us to learn web programming as well as working in a group with regular sprints.
