# Choose Tool for Documentation of JavaScript Code

## Context

In our project, we have multiple options for tools that can generate documentation from JavaScript code. We need a tool that can easily generate readable and accessible documentation directly from our source code.

## Considered Options

1. JSDoc: It is a widely-used tool that generates HTML documentation pages from JavaScript source code comments. It supports a rich set of tags and plugins, making it highly customizable.

2. ESDoc: Focuses on ECMAScript (ES6+) and provides a clear, concise documentation format. It includes coverage reporting and integrates well with modern JavaScript features.

3. Sphinx: Originally designed for Python documentation, Sphinx can be used for JavaScript as well, especially when combined with extensions like sphinx-js. It uses reStructuredText as its markup language and can produce a variety of output formats, including HTML and PDF.



## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: JSDoc, because:
1. JSDoc is widely used and well documented for JavaScript documentation, which makes it easier for new developers(us) to understand and use. We can benefit from robust community support and frequent updates.
2. Supports a comprehensive array of tags that are essential for documenting JavaScript code effectively. There is also an option to add tags if required in the future.
3. Implementing JSDoc as a workflow action in GitHub is straightforward, requiring only npm, which aligns with the existing requirements of our CI/CD pipelines.

## Rationale

While Sphinx offers robust documentation capabilities and the ability to produce multiple output formats, its primary alignment with Python and the need for additional extensions to handle JavaScript effectively makes it less ideal compared to JSDoc. ESDoc, while promising for ES6+ features, does not provide the same level of community support and extensibility as JSDoc.
