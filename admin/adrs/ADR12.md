# Use of Module Exports for Jest Testing

## Context
Utility functions in JavaScript need to be unit tested with Jest. For Jest to access these functions, they must be exported from their module.

## Considered Options
1. Export Functions Using `module.exports`: Standard, compatible with Jest, avoids redundancy, but requires explicitly marking functions for export.
2. Copy-Paste Functions into Test Files: Simplifies setup but creates redundancy and risks discrepancies.
3. Mock Functions with a Framework: Avoids modifying source files but adds unnecessary complexity for simple cases.

## Decision Outcome
We will use **`module.exports`** to export the functions. This approach ensures compatibility with Jest, eliminates redundancy, and aligns with standard JavaScript practices.

- Utility functions are explicitly exported.
- Test files import and use these functions directly.
