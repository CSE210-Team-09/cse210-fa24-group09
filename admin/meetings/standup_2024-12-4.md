    - Will let us know by friday?
    - If can’t give out the rubric, then will look over our repo and let us know if we have anything missing from repo
        - Will give us as much feedback as she can
- Final: final presentation during the slot (~15-20? min), and demo video (~10 min)
    - Class way larger this quarter so maybe not this many minutes
    - Process, architecture, lessons learned
    - Play videos in playlist first, then go up to present after all videos played
- Don’t stress too much, last class everyone got an A / one person or team got a B b/c missed midterm
- We aren’t grading the midterm anymore it seems -> TA’s will grade?
- Way we do meeting notes is fine, pushing it to the repo at end of sprint
