- Delete Note
- Edit Note
- Create Note (saving):
    - Implemented now: save note upon creation
    - Slight tweak: save and return button should be save and view → view the note instead of going to home page
        - Also don’t need popup alert that the note was saved
- View Note Bug	
    - When you copy code into the code box and try to view the note, it displays the output of the code not the code itself
- Next sprint: code formatting / bug fixes / testing / user trial / making UI pretty / having multiple code and comment blocks per note?
