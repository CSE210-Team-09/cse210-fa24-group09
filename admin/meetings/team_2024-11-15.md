## Agenda

- Discuss CI/CD pipeline tools and which tools we would prefer to use

## Completed Tasks

- Discussed CI/CD tooling
    - Linting
        - ESLint
            - Set syntax consistency and rules for code styling
        - Prettier
            - Code styling and formatting
            - Might be possible to link the two together
    - Code Quality via Tool
        - CodeClimate vs Codacy
            - Codacy overall fits our needs better
    - Github pages
        - Wanted to have 1 page for main [final prod] and 1 page for dev branch
        - But Github can only do 1 page so that will be for main
            - For dev, we will use a live server instead
    - Unit Tests
        - Jest
            - More minimalist, not the most feature intensive
            - Goes well with ESLint
        - Also looked into Ava
            - More of a learning curve
        - Also looked into Tape
            - Also more complex / learning curve
    - Documentation
        - JSDocs
            - Preference
            - Easy implementation and specifically for Javascript
            - Also available in Github Actions → can use directly in our workflow and don’t have to build ourselves
        - Doko
            - Mainly for coffee scripts, not really relevant
        - ESDocs
            - ES6 syntax javascript specific
            - Latest version of javascript
            - Not everything we use would be ES6 format
        - Sphinx
            - Generic one
            - More complex
    - E2E
        - Selenium
            - Only test function you’re viewing → if two functions connected, doesn’t go through and check the connection
        - Cypress
            - Parallel testing doesn’t work on cypress
        - Playwright
            - Good but not entirely free → only a few features free and the other are paid
        - Puppeteer
            - Good and also checks data input
            - Can do click/scroll
            - Only works on chrome and firefox
            - Can parallel testing
            - Should use this one

## Tasks to be completed

- Start work on pipeline via individual feature branches branched off of `dev` branch
- Branching Format:
    - `dev` branches off of `main`
    - Each ci/cd issue has a branch off of `dev`
        - Commit format example: Issue #1: `comment`
        - Branch names example: `cicd_linting`
- Ask Cora if we can make repo public and delete old branches

## Planned meetings

- Saturday 16th Nov 8:00PM Zoom
